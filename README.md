-All the products will appear on the Home page, but each seller can view his own products by clicking "My Products" from the Navbar.
-The seller can choose the name, category, price, benefits, and description for each product. The seller can also add images and a youtube video link of the product which can be played on the product's page.

On the customer side: 
-customers can search for a specific product in the search box by typing the name of the product or any word from the description or the benefits of the product.
-customers can also use the filters on the left to filter products by "Benefits" ,"Category" or "Price". Footer Â© 2022 GitHub, Inc. Footer navigation Terms Privacy Security Status Docs Contact GitHub Pricing API Training Blog
